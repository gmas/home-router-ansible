# 
# This file is used to define the hosts that are accessible when the firewall is
# stopped or is being stopped.
# 
# Warning
# 
# Changes to this file do not take effect until after the next shorewall start, 
# shorewall restart, or shorewall compile command.
# 
# The columns in the file are as follows (where the column name is followed by a
# different name in parentheses, the different name is used in the alternate
# specification syntax).
# 
# ACTION - ACCEPT|NOTRACK|DROP
# 
#     Determines the disposition of the packet.
# 
#     ACCEPT means that the packet will be accepted.
# 
#     NOTRACK indicates that no conntrack entry should be created for the packet.
#     NOTRACK does not imply ACCEPT.
# 
#     DROP was added in Shorewall 4.6.0 and causes the packet to be dropped in
#     the raw table's PREROUTING chain.
# 
# SOURCE - [-|[$FW|interface]|[{$FW|interface}[:address[,address]...]]|[address[,
#     address]...]
# 
#     $FW matches packets originating on the firewall itself, while interface
#     specifies packets arriving on the named interface.
# 
#     This column may also include a comma-separated list of IP/subnet addresses.
#     If your kernel and iptables include iprange match support, IP address
#     ranges are also allowed. Ipsets and exclusion are also supported. When $FW
#     or interface are specified, the list must be preceded by a colon (":").
# 
#     If left empty or supplied as "-", 0.0.0.0/0 is assumed.
# 
# DEST - [-|[$FW|interface]|[{$FW|interface}[:address[,address]...]]|[address[,
#     address]...]
# 
#     $FW matches packets addressed the firewall itself, while interface
#     specifies packets arriving on the named interface. Neither may be specified
#     if the target is NOTRACK or DROP.
# 
#     This column may also include a comma-separated list of IP/subnet addresses.
#     If your kernel and iptables include iprange match support, IP address
#     ranges are also allowed. Ipsets and exclusion are also supported. When $FW
#     or interface are specified, the list must be preceded by a colon (":").
# 
#     If left empty or supplied as "-", 0.0.0.0/0 is assumed.
# 
# PROTO (Optional) ‒ protocol-name-or-number[,...]
# 
#     Protocol.
# 
#     Beginning with Shorewall 4.5.12, this column can accept a comma-separated
#     list of protocols.
# 
# DEST PORT(S) (dport) ‒ service-name/port-number-list
# 
#     Optional. A comma-separated list of port numbers and/or service names from
#     /etc/services. May also include port ranges of the form low-port:high-port
#     if your kernel and iptables include port range support.
# 
# SOURCE PORT(S) (sport) ‒ service-name/port-number-list
# 
#     Optional. A comma-separated list of port numbers and/or service names from
#     /etc/services. May also include port ranges of the form low-port:high-port
#     if your kernel and iptables include port range support.
# 
#     Beginning with Shorewall 4.5.15, you may place '=' in this column, provided
#     that the DEST PORT(S) column is non-empty. This causes the rule to match
#     when either the source port or the destination port in a packet matches one
#     of the ports specified in DEST PORTS(S). Use of '=' requires multi-port
#     match in your iptables and kernel.
